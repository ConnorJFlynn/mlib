few notes: 

The main program is SizeDist_Optics. Type help SizeDist_Optics

Don't forget that you need both my code and the Maetzler package. 

This program is provided without any warranty or help, although I will try to fix reported bugs eventually.

The program MultiMieRuns, along with SampleInputFile.xls, allows you to specify many simulations in an Excel file (the sample file is SampleInputFile). It uses xls2struc and therefore doesn't work on Mac. This one is REALLY provided without help-- I assume that by the time you get to multiple Mie runs, you're good enough at figuring stuff out to read the program on your own.
