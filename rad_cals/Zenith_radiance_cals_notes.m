% SAS-Ze radiance calibrations, notes and general organization

% Have applied responsivities for SWS from calibrations conducted by
% Sebastian Schmidt et al at Boulder.  Have independently reproduced
% responsivity computations.  Patric McBride has confirmed agreement with
% Cimel sky radiances to within 6% or so.

% Have computed a subset of responsivity cals from the SAS-Ze2 deployed at
% Cape Cod (PVC).  Cal data collected by Albert Jan 9, 2013 at GSGC. Have confirmed
% qualitative agreement with Cimel radiances from cloud mode for both sun
% and sky channels, with Cimel radiances from PPL sky scans, and with NFOV2
% channels. 

% Have conducted a calibration excercise March 14, 2013 at GSFC with SWS,
% SASZe2 (PVC), SASZe1 (MAGIC).  The SASZe2 collector was upgraded to model
% 2 (no motion control, dual depolarizer, baffle) and calibrated again.
% Need to: 
% 1: compare SASZe2 post-TCAP cal with Jan 9 cal.
% 2: compare SWS March 14 cal with Dec 12 cal.
% 3. Compute responsivities for SAS-Ze1 for Magic.
% 4. Compute SASZe2 Model 2 responsivity
