This series of files provides an interface to the following AER codes:

LNFL version 2.0
LBLRTM version 11.3
RADSUM version 2.4
RRTM_LW version 3.01
RRTM_SW version 2.5

These programs must be installed on your system and running properly.  
If you have compiled these programs under something other than
the PGF 90 compiler for linux using double-precision,  you will need to modify
the names of the executables which are listed in the call_* scripts

The matlab script that can be called is 'call_run_radsum_mod_atm_example.m'
to recreate the data for the figure seen at http://rtweb.aer.com/lblrtm_frame.html
Another matlab script that can be called is 'call_run_lblrtm_sgp_aeri_comparison.m' which 
recreates the data for the figure seen at http://rtweb.aer.com/ .  The actual aeri spectrum is also included.
Also, the matlab script 'call_run_lblrtm_camex_comparison.m' recreates
the data for the example given by the lblrtm website.  The actual camex spectrum is also included

call_run_radsum_mod_atm_example.m = 
     sample case for calling run_radsum for mid-latitude summer conditions as posted in the Clough and Iacono, 1995 (JGR-Atmospheres)
     (note, this case is computationally intensive and takes around 1 hour on a Xeon 3.2 GHz processor)

run_radsum.m = copies relevant files for radsum,lblrtm,lnfl and executes these programs after calling write_radsum_tape5.m, reads results
run_lblrtm.m = copies relevant files for lblrtm,lnfl and executes these programs after calling write_lblrtm_tape5.m, reads results
write_radsum_tape5.m = writes input files for lnfl, lblrtm, and radsum according to inputs
write_lblrtm_tape5.m = writes input files for lnfl and lblrtm according to inputs

read_radsum.m = reads OUTPUT_RADSUM file into matlab
truncate_header.m = modifies TAPE27 and TAPE28 files (radiance and brightness temperature) so they can be read quickly into matlab

convert_to_BT.m = gets brightness temperature from radiance values
get_flag.m = gets value of flag/switch from flag/switch vector
get_directory.m = gets value of directory from directory_mat
set_directory.m = sets value of directory from directory_mat

I have included the lnfl, lblrtm, and radsum input files from the call_run_radsum_mod_atm_example.m routine as well 
and these are labeled MLS_example*

I have also included the lnfl and lblrtm input files produced by call_run_lblrtm_sgp_aeri_comparison.m
and these files are labeled sgp_aeri*

Also, the calls to charts are currently experimental and do not work properly yet.
