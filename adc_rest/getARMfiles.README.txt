README for getARMfiles utility:

This Matlab utility allows a user to query the ARM Archive for available files from a specified datastream between supplied start and end dates, and to collect and save these files to a local system.

Syntax: files = getARMFiles(mask, str_date, end_data, savedir)
mask: user-provided string in the form of sssDDDDDDFFF.dd 
	"sss" is the three-leter site designation, e.g., "sgp"
	"DDDDDD" is the datastream stem, eg: "ceil"
	"FFF" is the facility and number, eg: "C1", "E13", "M1", etc.
	"dd" is the data level, eg "a1", "b1", "c1", etc.
str_date: user-provided start date in the form of "yyyy-mm-dd"
end_date: user-provided end date in the form of "yyyy-mm-dd"
savedir: user-provided local path where files should be saved
files: list of files retrieved from ARMlive RESTful web services

This utility is designed for either interactive or programmatic use, such that it will operate "hands-off" if all arguments are provided, but will prompt the user for interaction if critical elements are missing.

Functional dependencies:
setARMusertoken: interactively obtains and saves usertoken for a given ARM User
getARMusertoken: automatically obtains saved user token from setARMusertoken

Has been tested for 2022a on Window 10 and Matlab On-Line running a variant of Linux
