I’d love to have a copy of that if you’re willing to share it.  Full credit will be given, for sure.  I want to apply it to the ASSIST spectra (Luc’s alternative to the AERI) and also see what modifications are necessary in applying it to my shortwave spectrometer.  Looks like I’ll need to pre-normalize my spectra versus the NESR to ensure that the errors are normal and Gaussian.
