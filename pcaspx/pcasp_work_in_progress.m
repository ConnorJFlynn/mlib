%Replicate PACS display numbers:

In order to compute the avg diameter, I need a table of sizes. 
1. Compute scattering cs vs AD 0-4095 for each range based on PSL cals.
2. Compute regressed values from CS to particle diameter assuming index of refraction of water.
3. To get a feel for this, try plotting the DMT supplied table relationships between threshold and size
