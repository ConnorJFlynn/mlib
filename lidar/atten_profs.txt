First, use std_atm for temperature and pressure or provide other profiles.
Then, with the TP profs, calculating Rayleigh alpha and beta.

Then add whatever alpha and beta profiles to the above as desired.

Then calculate optical depth as a function of altitude and extinction profile too.

Then calculate attenuated backscatter profile.
